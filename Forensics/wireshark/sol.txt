Step 1: Use Wireshark to open the file

Step 2: Click "Analyze > Follow > TCP Stream" and try to find some useful message

Step 3: When you switch to "Stream 5", you would find a string that looks like the flag

        `Gur synt vf cvpbPGS{c33xno00_1_f33_h_qrnqorrs}`

Step 4: Use ROD13 to decrypt it and you would find the true message

        `The flag is picoCTF{p33kab00_1_s33_u_deadbeef}`
